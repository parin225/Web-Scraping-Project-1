# Web-Scraping-Project-1

This project consists of building a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML Page.

- The initial scraping was done using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinters to scrape information from various different websites. 

- Afterwards, a new HTML page was created using MongoDB with Flask templating to display all of the information that was scraped from the intiail step. 

Final HTML Page:
